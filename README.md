# Connect-4

- Utilized vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS to build an enjoyable game from the ground up
- Created a fully functional computer AI opponent that capitalizes on winning setups and blocks your attempts to win
- The goal was to demo my Javascript skills through a simple game with a relatively complex logical framework as it relates to the DOM
- Solo project
- Please feel free and hop on and play a game against that insidious computer opponent!
